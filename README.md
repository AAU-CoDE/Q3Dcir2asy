# Q3Dcir2asy
Create a pre-populated LTSpice symbol for Ansys Q3D generated subcircuits.

LTSpice can create a generic symbol for a subcircuit (open `.cir` file in LTSpice → right click on the subcircuit name → Create Symbol). However, all pins are named with consecutive numbers. Ansys Q3D embeds pin names as comments in the generated `.cir` file. 

# Input
`.cir` equivalent circuit model generated by Ansys Q3D.

# Output
`.asy` LTSpice symbol file pre-populated with pin names as defined in Ansys Q3D sinks and sources.
